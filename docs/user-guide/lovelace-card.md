# HAEO forecast card

The HAEO forecast card is a custom Lovelace card that renders HAEO `forecast` attributes as a fast interactive SVG chart.
It is designed for fixed-horizon data and uses a MobX state model so hover and timeline updates stay responsive.

## What the card shows

The card reads `forecast` attributes from HAEO output sensors.
It automatically groups series into lanes (`power`, `price`, `soc`, `shadow`, `other`).
Power and price series are drawn with step-post semantics.
State-of-charge series are drawn as continuous lines.

## Prerequisites

You must already have the HAEO integration installed and running.
At least one HAEO output sensor must expose a `forecast` attribute.

## Card resources register themselves

There is nothing to add by hand. The integration serves its bundles under
`/haeo-static/` and registers them with the frontend on startup.

Entry filenames carry a content hash — for example
`/haeo-static/haeo-forecast-card.entry.<hash>.js` — and change with every build, so they
must not be pinned in a Lovelace resource. Hashing every emitted file is what allows the
bundles to be served with long-lived cache headers: no stable URL survives a rebuild, so
a cached copy can never be served alongside a newer one.

If you added a manual Lovelace resource for these cards under an older release, **remove
it**. It pins a filename that no longer exists, and a stale cached copy loaded beside the
current bundle will race it to register the same custom element.

## Basic card config

```yaml
type: custom:haeo-forecast-card
title: HAEO forecast
hub_entry_id: <your_haeo_hub_config_entry_id>
```

Use the visual card editor to select a HAEO hub. Forecast entities for that hub are discovered automatically at runtime.

## Configuration options

- `type`: Must be `custom:haeo-forecast-card`.
- `title`: Optional card title.
- `hub_entry_id`: Required HAEO hub config entry ID (chosen via the visual editor).
- `entities`: Optional list of forecast sensor entities. When omitted, the card discovers forecast sensors for the selected hub.
- `height`: Optional chart height in pixels.
- `power_display_mode`: `opposed` or `overlay`. Default is `opposed`.
- `default_horizon`: Initial horizon slider value. One of `full`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `1d`, `2d`, or `3d`. Default is `full`. Shorter values are used automatically when the forecast horizon is shorter than the configured value.
- `tooltip_visible`: Whether the information panel below the chart is shown initially. Default is `true`.

## Interaction features

- Hover crosshair with nearest-point value snapping.
- Tooltip with per-series values and per-lane totals.
- Legend hover highlighting.
- Automatic scaling based on card dimensions.
- Chart updates when forecast data changes from Home Assistant.

## Network topology card

The integration also registers `custom:haeo-topology-card` as a separate frontend resource.
It reads the `topology` attribute from a HAEO optimization status sensor and renders the LP network as an interactive SVG graph.

### Basic topology card config

```yaml
type: custom:haeo-topology-card
title: HAEO network topology
hub_entry_id: <your_haeo_hub_config_entry_id>
```

Use the visual card editor to select a HAEO hub. The card resolves the hub's optimization status sensor at runtime.

### Topology card options

- `type`: Must be `custom:haeo-topology-card`.
- `title`: Optional card title.
- `hub_entry_id`: Required HAEO hub config entry ID (chosen via the visual editor).

## Troubleshooting

If the card shows an empty state:

- **Configure a HAEO hub**: Open the card editor and select a hub.
- **The selected HAEO hub no longer exists**: Your hub was removed or recreated. Open the card editor and choose the current hub again.
- **No forecast data yet** / **No optimization status sensor**: HAEO is still starting up or has not finished its first optimization run.

For forecast data issues, also confirm:

- Each forecast entity has a populated `forecast` attribute.
- No stale manual Lovelace resource is pinning an old card filename (see above).
