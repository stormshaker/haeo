# HAEO forecast card frontend

This package builds the HAEO Lovelace custom card bundles with [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) (Rollup-compatible bundler with tree-shaking and minification).

## Commands

- `npm run build` builds the card bundles into `custom_components/haeo/www/` via Rolldown. Filenames carry a content hash, so the build prints what it emitted.
- `npm run dev` watches and rebuilds during frontend work.
- `npm run test` runs frontend unit and smoke tests.
- `npm run test:coverage` runs tests with coverage reports and threshold enforcement.
- `npm run typecheck` runs strict TypeScript checks.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint.
- `npm run format` runs Prettier format checks.
- `npm run check` runs the full quality gate (`typecheck`, `lint`, `format`, coverage tests).
- `npm run storybook` runs isolated component stories.
- `npm run build-storybook` builds static Storybook output.
- `npm run preview:svg` exports an actual rendered card SVG preview to `previews/card-preview.svg`.

## Bundling

- **Bundler**: Rolldown (`rolldown.config.mjs`) with ESM output and minification.
- **Independent bundles**: each card is built and registered as its own Lovelace resource, so a stale or missing copy of one card can never break registration of the other.
- **Instant registration via thin entry + lazy controller**: Home Assistant only guarantees a custom card through `customElements.whenDefined` plus a short timeout, so gating `customElements.define` behind a large dependency graph causes the intermittent "Custom element doesn't exist" race. Each card's registered entry (`haeo-forecast-card.entry.<hash>.js`, `haeo-topology-card.entry.<hash>.js`, ~5 KB each) contains only the element class and `customElements.define`, with no heavy imports, so registration happens immediately regardless of bundle size or network speed. The heavy rendering stack (preact, MobX, ELK) lives in a lazily-imported controller chunk (`haeo-forecast-card.forecast-card-controller.<hash>.js` ~130 KB, `haeo-topology-card.topology-card-controller.<hash>.js` with ELK ~1.4 MB) loaded on first use. Entry and chunk filenames both carry a content hash and are prefixed per card, so the bundles can be served with long-lived cache headers without any stable URL surviving a rebuild to serve a stale copy.
- **Tree-shaking**: unused dependency exports are dropped; app modules keep side-effect imports (`customElements.define`, CSS).
- **Node helper**: `dist/render-topology-svg.mjs` is built in the same Rolldown config for SVG export scripts.

## Test data strategy

Behavioral tests use real HAEO scenario outputs from `tests/scenarios/*/outputs.json`.
This keeps the frontend ingestion model aligned with real integration payloads.
